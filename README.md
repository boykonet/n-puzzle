# n-puzzle

This project focuses on developing an AI algorithm to solve the `n-puzzle` problem, including variants such as the 8-puzzle, 15-puzzle, etc.

At its core, the project leverages the A* (A-Star) algorithm, enhanced by selected heuristic functions:

- Manhattan Distance
- Euclidean Distance
- Chebyshev Distance

These heuristics are implemented to optimize the algorithm's performance and provide efficient solutions for the puzzle.
